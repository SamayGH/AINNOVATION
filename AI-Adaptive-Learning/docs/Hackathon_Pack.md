# AI Adaptive Learning for Rural Youth – Hackathon Pack

## Introduction
A human-centered, offline-first, AI-adaptive platform for rural learners (12–25). It personalizes academics, vocational content, and digital literacy in local languages, connects learners to mentors, and bridges to local jobs.

## Problem
Connectivity gaps, shortage of trained teachers, generic non-localized content, weak transitions from learning to earning.

## Solution
- AI-powered mobile app adapts content difficulty, pace, and focus in real time.
- Works offline with SQLite caching and conflict-aware sync; auto-syncs to cloud.
- Teacher co-pilot (web): diagnostics, grouping, lesson plans, mastery heatmaps.
- Mentors & job board: local pathways to employment and guidance.

## Key Features
1) Adaptive engine (Bayesian/mastery + spaced practice)  
2) Multilingual UI + content (Azure Translator, TTS/STT)  
3) Offline-first UX (predictive prefetch, graceful degrade)  
4) Gamification (streaks, badges, XP)  
5) Safety & privacy by design (PII separation, consent)  

## Technical Architecture (Azure)
- React Native app ↔ Node/Express on **Azure App Service**
- Content/media on **Azure Blob Storage**
- MongoDB (Atlas/VM) for state; SQLite offline on device
- AI via Python models + **Azure Cognitive Services** for language & speech
- **Azure Monitor** for logs/metrics; Power BI for dashboards

See: `architecture/diagram.mmd` and `architecture/diagram.svg`

## KPIs & Impact
- Learning: +0.3 SD in 8 weeks; 30% faster mastery
- Engagement: WAU > 60%; D7 retention > 40%
- Access: 80% usage offline; crash rate < 0.5%
- Employability: 25% complete a micro-credential; 10% get internships/jobs in 6 months

## Roadmap
- Hackathon: MVP topic (Math), Hindi UI, offline cache, dashboard demo
- 0–3 months: English + digital literacy, mentor directory, job listings
- 3–6 months: TTS/ASR, micro-credentials, employer verification

## Ethics & Inclusion
Local language, high-contrast UI, TTS, low-literacy onboarding, community review of content, bias checks on items and recommendations.

## Pitch Script (30–90s)
“We meet learners where they are — offline, in their language — and adapt to how they learn. Teachers get a co‑pilot; learners get mentors and jobs. Affordable, scalable, and built for real rural constraints.”
